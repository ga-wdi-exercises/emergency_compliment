# WDI Emergency Compliment- Git-Teams-Starter (Angular)

## OBJECTIVE

Create your own version of [Emergency Compliment](http://emergencycompliment.com/) using Angular!

When a user visits the site, they should be greeted with a random compliment to cheer them up.

We are "faking" a back-end by using `data.js` for our compliments.

## Set-Up:

1. `git clone`
2. `$ cd emergency_compliment`
3. `$ git checkout git-teams-starter`
3. `$ hs`
4.  visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser!

## Level 1: Generic Compliment

When you visit the root `http://localhost:8080/` it should display a randomly chosen compliment.
